# AuE8230Spring22_AkshitLunia
Hi, I am Akshit Lunia.

This repository was created to showcase all that I have learned about turtlebot3 and it's simulation while taking the course AUE 8230 (Autonomy, systems and sciences).

For assignment 2:

The circle.py python script moves the robot in a circular path. You can specify the radius by giving the linear velocity and angular velocity.

The square_openloop.py uses Twist to move the turtlebot in a straight line till a specified distance and rotates the turtlebot by 90 degrees and continues moving in a straight line. This is continuously done to make the robot move in a square path.

The square_closedloop.py uses Pose to move the turtlebot to specified coordinates to make a square.
